NOTES

The code provided in this package was written by Julian N. Ilinca as a part of a Master's
Thesis work for Aalto University.

The code needs the Levenberg_marquardt and Jacobian toolboxes provided in the links
below to run correctly. Place the m. files in the same folder as the rest of the source 
code provided.

RUNNING THE CODE

To run the code open the sim_main.m file and press play.
You can choose how many time the code is run by changing the value of  the "n_calls" parameter at the 
beggining of the function.

To choose with which sampling frequency to simulate, first open the fiveGHz_main.m function and change the
values of parameters "step" and "num_p" as shown in the comments.
